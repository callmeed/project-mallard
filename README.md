# Project Mallard

Programming exercises for the real world. Emphasis on learning a new language or interviews. 

## What is it? 

This is a set of programming exercises to help an experienced programmer like me (and maybe you) learning a new language. For example, I'm pretty good at Ruby but I'd like to learn Python. 

The exercises are designed around my real-world experience as a programmer and use tangible concepts. Think "Project Euler but with exercises about web-dev, sports, ecommerce, and real-world APIs"

## Who are these exercises for? 

* People who want to learn a Nth language (where N > 1) with increasingly difficult exercises
* People who want to brush up on a language they haven't used in a long time 
* People who want some exercises to help prepare for an interview
* People who conduct interviews and need some inspiration

NOTE: with regards to interviews, this will probably only be useful for interviewees/interviewers who want specific types of exercises. If your interview is algorithmic and focused on data structures, _these are not the exercises you're looking for_.

## How to Get Started? 

Clone the project. Start at exercise 1. 

## I have a new/better solution to an exercise, can I submit a pull-request? 

Sure.

## Why "Mallard"? 

Ducks can fly, swim, and walk. They aren't the best at any one, but they get the job done. They're like the polyglot, full-stack developer of the animal world.
