# Project Mallard

Programming exercises for the real world. Emphasis on learning a new language or interviews.

## What is it?

This is a set of programming exercises to help an experienced programmer like me (and maybe you) learning a new language. For example, I'm pretty good at Ruby but I'd like to learn Python.

The exercises are designed around my real-world experience as a programmer and use tangible concepts. Think "Project Euler but with exercises about web-dev, sports, ecommerce, and real-world APIs"

## Who are these exercises for?

* People who want to learn a Nth language (where N > 1) with increasingly difficult exercises
* People who want to brush up on a language they haven't used in a long time
* People who want some exercises to help prepare for an interview
* People who conduct interviews and need some inspiration

NOTE: with regards to interviews, this will probably only be useful for interviewees/interviewers who want specific types of exercises. If your interview is algorithmic and focused on data structures, _these are not the exercises you're looking for_.

## How to Get Started?

1. Clone the project. Start at exercise 1 and look at the info file
2. Attempt to complete each exercise in the language of your choice
3. When you're done, compare to the appropriate solution in the repo
4. If you have a new or better solution, submit a pull request

## Why "Mallard"?

Ducks can fly, swim, and walk. They aren't the best at any one, but they get the job done. They're like the polyglot, full-stack developer of the animal world.

Have you ever seen a dolphin walk? Have you ever seen a cheetah fly? Didn't think so.
